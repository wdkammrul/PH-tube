          Q: 01: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </h1>
        <ol>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">*** Var ***</h1>
            <h1>
              1. var variables are function-scoped. This means that they are
              only accessible within the function in which they are declared,
              regardless of where they are declared within that function.
            </h1>
          </li>
          <li>
            2. If declared outside of any function, var variables become
            globally scoped, making them accessible throughout the entire
            JavaScript program.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. var variables are also subject to "hoisting," which means that
            they are moved to the top of their containing function or global
            context during compilation. However, their assignments are not
            hoisted.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="my-8">
          <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">*** let ***</h1>
          <li>
            1. let variables are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible
            within the nearest pair of curly braces { } where they are declared.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted to the top of their
            containing block, and they are not accessible before their
            declaration.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. You can reassign a let variable within its scope, but you cannot
            declare another let variable with the same name in the same scope.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">*** const ***</h1>
          <li>
            1. Like let, const variables are block-scoped and not hoisted.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. However, const variables have an additional restriction: they
            cannot be reassigned after they are declared. They are constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. When you declare a const variable and assign a value to it, you
            must provide an initial value, and you cannot change that value
            later.
          </li>

          <li>
            1. Is explicitly assigned to variables or properties to signify an
            intentional absence or emptiness of a value.

          <li>
            2. Used when you want to reset a variable's value or indicate that
            an object property should have no meaningful value.

          <li>
            3. Provides a clear way to represent emptiness or the lack of an

          Q: 03: What do you mean by REST API?
        </h1>

        <ol class="mt-8">
          <li>
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
            Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for designing web
            services that enable different software applications to communicate
            with each other over the internet. It follows a specific
            architectural style and uses standard HTTP methods and URLs to
            interact with resources. Here's a simplified explanation:
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="mt-8">
              <span class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8"
                >1. Representational State Transfer (REST):</span
              >
              REST is an architectural style that emphasizes using standard HTTP
              methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URLs to interact with
              resources. It promotes stateless communication, where each client
              request to a server contains all the necessary information for the
              server to understand and process the request.
            </h1>
          </li>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="mt-8">
              <span class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8"
                >2. Application Programming Interface (API):</span
              >
              An API defines how different software components should interact.
              In the context of REST, it specifies the rules and conventions for
              requesting and manipulating resources over the web.
            </h1>
          </li>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="mt-8">
              <span class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8"
                >3. HTTP Methods:</span
              >
               REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST,
              PUT, DELETE, and others to perform actions on resources. For
              example: GET: Retrieve data from the server. POST: Create a new
              resource on the server. PUT: Update an existing resource on the
              server. DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
            </h1>
          </li>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="mt-8">
              <span class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8"
                >4. URLs:</span
              >
             Resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Each resource has a unique URL that allows clients to access or manipulate it. For example, https://openapi.programming-hero.com/api/videos/category/1000 might represent the user with ID 1000.
            </h1>
          </li>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="mt-8">
              <span class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8"
                >5. Statelessness:</span
              >
               REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request to the server should include all the information needed to understand and fulfill that request. The server does not rely on the client's previous interactions.
            </h1>
          </li>
          <li class="text-start">
            <h1 class="mt-8">
              <span class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8"
                >6. Data Formats: </span
              >
           Data is typically exchanged in common formats like JSON or XML. These formats are used to structure and transmit information between the client and server.
